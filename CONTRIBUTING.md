# Contributing to Nix documentation

The Nix Book is a community effort to collect, create, and maintain world-class learning resources for Nix.

We strongly encourage everyone interested to contribute by asking informed questions or directly proposing changes.

Open an issue if you want to clarify something not evident from what is provided in this repository, or if you want to discuss a significant change before starting to work on it.

Make a pull request if you want to introduce an incremental change.
Note our [considerations on licensing and attribution](#licensing-and-attribution).

## You want to learn and use Nix?

This book would not be possible without you.
Try to use it as your primary resource, however incomplete it may appear.

We ask you to liberally open issues and document all problems and questions that arise.
Please also state your learning goals and the paths you have taken so far.

Sharing your first-hand experience is invaluable to better guide our efforts, and will immediately help improve the book for yourself and everyone else.

## You have experience teaching Nix?

You will probably have observed where learners get stuck most often, and which typical needs and questions they have.
You may have your own written notes for classes, trainings, or presentations.

Please share your experience and help us inform the structure and detailed contents of this book.
It would be great if you could contribute examples, wordings, or illustrations that proved helpful to your students.

## You are a domain expert using Nix?

If you are proficient in applying Nix to a domain-specific problem, and want to share your expertise on best practices, please check the table of contents.
Does existing material on your subject meet your standards?
How could we improve it?
Is there a popular application of Nix' capabilities not yet covered?
We would be glad to incorporate your insights.

# Guidelines

Here are values and practical guidelines to go by when contributing.

## Values

### Be kind

Adapted from [Contributor Covenant](contributor-covenant) and [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](carpentries-coc):

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Show empathy and respect towards other people
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Give and gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community

[contributor-covenant]: https://github.com/EthicalSource/contributor_covenant/blob/cd7fcf684249786b7f7d47ba49c23a6bcb3233eb/content/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.md?plain=1#L25-L31
[carpentries-coc]: https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/blob/4691971d9f49544054410334140a4fd391a738da/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.md?plain=1#L15-L19

### Be truthful

The only thing more confusing than no documentation is misleading documentation.

#### Use and provide evidence

This book should enable readers to answer all their questions on their own.

Provide [links](#links) to the [online Nix manual][nix-manual] or other resources, if it would help guide readers on their learning journey.
It is explicitly within scope of this project, and encouraged by Nix maintainers, to update or restructure the [Nix manual source code][nix-manual-src] where appropriate, to improve the overall experience.

Similarly, the other information in this repository should enable contributors to answer most of their questions and correct obvious errors on their own, and only then resort to opening issues.

Errors get more obvious if we can measure execution against intent.
Therefore we ask you to always make explicit the motivation behind your proposed changes.

Add references to any relevant resources in commit messages, if it helps understand the reasoning behind a significant change.

[nix-manual]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/
[nix-manual-src]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/doc/manual

#### Ensure working code samples

Code samples must always be working correctly when run as instructed.
Nix provides us with everything needed to make this happen.

Currently we have no automated tooling in place to assist with this, and pull requests to address that question are very welcome.

### Be concise

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.
>
> â€” [Blaise Pascal][shorter-letter]

This book is for the readers, and their time and attention is limited.
Take the time to be extraordinarily respectful with their cognitive resources.

You can use diagrams or illustrations to support written descriptions.
[GitHub allows creating Mermaid diagrams within Markdown.][github-mermaid]

The same holds for communication directed to contributors and maintainers:
This is a public project, and many people will read what you write.
Use this leverage with care.

## Guides

### How to contribute effectively?

Different audiences require different levels of sophistication, and both readers' and contributors' available time and expertise varies widely.

The following diagram shows a pipeline for contributions to learning material and documentation.
Use it to decide where to best put the results of your efforts, depending on how much time you can spend on refining them to get accepted.

Communication platforms are distinguished by mode of interaction:
- append to streams
  - amount of infomation grows without bounds
  - only recent items are relevant
- change artifacts
  - amount of information is strictly bounded
  - all items are relevant

Arrows point towards
- decreasing rate of change
- increasing public visibility
- increasing amount of scrutiny.

Arrows indicate possibilities to promote existing material to more prominent and more easily discoverable locations.

- Matrix

  Use Matrix for casual communication.

  The documentation team frequents the [Nix\* Documentation] room.

  Old messages are extremely improbable to be read by anyone.
  Feel free to post what you have found valuable on [Discourse][discourse].

- meetings and events

  Check the [Discourse community calendar][calendar] for real-time events.

  The documentation team holds regular meetings and posts meeting notes in the [Documentation][docs] category.

- external sources

  The Internet is full of helpful resources concerning Nix.
  Feel free to share what you have found valuable on Discourse in the [Links][links] category.

- Discourse

  [Discourse][discourse] is the central community hub.
  This is the place for your questions, suggestions, and discussion.

  The documentation team monitors the [Documentation][docs] category.

  Old threads and especially posts in long threads are improbable to be read by many people.
  Feel free to write down what you have learned in a [NixOS Wiki][wiki] article, or update an existing article.

- Wiki

  [NixOS Wiki][wiki] is a collection of interlinked guides to solve well-known problems.
  It is collectively edited by the community.

  The Wiki is a dumping ground for Nix knowledge.
  Its purpose is to quickly and conveniently collect insights and make them readily available when needed.
  It covers a broad range of topics, is only loosely organized, and does not impose quality standards.

  The documentation team monitors changes to maintain an overview of topics of interest and prevent vandalism.

  You can help with
  - improving discoverability by adding categorization.
  - clarifying articles and correcting errors
  - migrating information to other resources.

  Guidelines for migration:
  - Nix interaction: [Nix manual][nix-manual]
  - Language-specific build instructions: [Nixpkgs manual][nixpkgs-manual]
  - Package, service, or hardware configuration: [NixOS manual][nixos-manual]
  - Ecosystem overview and best practices: [The Nix Book][book]

- manuals

  The manuals for
  - [Nix][nix-manual]
  - [Nixpkgs][nixpkgs-manual]
  - [NixOS][nixos-manual]

  are primarily reference documentation, specifying interfaces and behavior.
  They also show example interactions to show how to use its components, and explain mechanisms where necessary.

  The documentation team assists contributors to get their changes to the manuals merged.

- The Nix Book

  The book's purpose is to guide newcomers by teaching essential Nix knowledge, show best practices, and help orient users in the Nix ecosystem.
  It goes into breadth, not depth.

  The documentation team maintains The Nix Book as editors.

- web site

  The Nix project web site is [nixos.org][www].
  Web site contents that concern learning Nix should reference or include material from The Nix Book.

  The [Nix markting team][marketing] is responsible for the web site, and the documentation team assists with maintaining contents related to onboarding.
